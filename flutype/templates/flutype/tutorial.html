        <h1>Tutorial: How to upload data</h1>
        <div class="row align-left">

            <p>
                Uploading data into the database consists of two main parts, filling in generic data reused in
            multiple experiments, and experiment or measurement specific data:
            <ul>
            <li>The first part is the <b>creation of generic data</b> which is used in multiple <code>measurements</code>
                or <code>studies</code>.<br />
                This generic data is reused, e.g., <code>ligands</code> like peptides or viruses are only defined once,
                same for the respective <code>batches</code> (i.e., solutions of peptides, viruses and antibodies),
                or the experimental steps (so called <code>process steps</code>) which are used in multiple
                <code>measurements</code> or <code>studies</code>.<br />
                This generic data can be added/modified directly in the browser via the web interface (for instance by
                adding new peptides or viruses). A user must be logged in to add/modfiy this data.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second part is the upload of <b>data specific for a given measurement/experiment</b>.<br />
                For the upload the information must hereby be provided in a specific directory structure,
                i.e., certain files with defined names must exist in a given folder.<br />

                When creating the files in this specific directory structure, it is important to check
                that the generic <code>ligands</code> (peptides, viruses, antibodies, ...), the used <code>batches</code> (solutions of the ligands)
                and the experimental steps (<code>process steps</code>) have already been uploaded in the database
                (see generic information above).
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The largest unit in the database is a so called <code>study</code> which
            refers to a collection of <code>measurements</code>. This tutorial leads through the workflow of
            uploading experimental data for an example <code>study</code> containing <code>measurements</code> from an
            ELISA binding assay (microwell plate), a peptide-virus binding experiment (microwell plate), and
                a peptide-virus binding experiment on a peptide-array.
            </p>

            The specific directory structure for this example <code>study</code> is provided in the following supplementary
            file: <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"> flutype-tutorial.zip </a>. The example study
                was uploaded in the FluTypeDB an is available <a href="{{ url("tutorial_db")}}"> here </a>.

            <h2> 1. Study </h2>
            <p>
                The name of the folder in
                the directory will be displayed in the database as the sid (identifaiction string) of a study. I
                recommend to find a convention for the naming of the studies to not get name conflicts.
                Since our study is a tutorial, I name my study: "170929-tutorial".
                A study is build up off three blocks: metadata, measurements, and raw docs.
                Let's start with the metadata. The meta data is the only obligatory information of a study if
                you want you can only add a study without any measurements or raw docs by adding a "meta.tsv" into
                a directory with the name of the study and your are done. Metadata of a study contains a task,
                result and status.
                Task, result and status are described by accordingly named fields in "meta.tsv" in the main
                directory of the study. Anytime I talk about the content and about what has to to placed where in
                the
                directory of the study you can go and check the
                <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"> zip </a>
                or <a href="{{ url("tutorial_tree")}}"> directory tree</a> what I am talking about. Don't worry if
                you do not have results of a study while writing the metadata. They can be updated afterwards.
                Actually all of the meta fields are optional.
                Results related documents can be uploaded into the folder "raw_docs". The raw docs folder will be
                explained later. Now back to the metadata of our example. The status can be choosen from three
                options:
                "planned", "in progress" and "finished".

                The following table shows the metadata of my study. This table is saved as "meta.tsv" in the main
                directory of the study. I have not yet defined a result of my task ;).</p>

            <table class="table table-striped">

                <tr>
                    <th> task</th>
                    <td> The task of the study is to demonstrate how a study can be uploaded into the database.
                        Therefore, three different types of experiments are included into the study. The aim is to

                        what
                        can be uploaded and how.

            Alright, we have defined a study. Most importantly, we can add measurements to our study.
            This is going to be covered in the next section. But further, it is possible to upload any
            additional documents related to the study. To do so, just paste them into the "raw_docs" folder of
            the study. For this study, I add the
            <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}">zipped folder </a>
            of the study to the raw docs. Now, let's go ahead and add some measurements to the study.

            <h2> 2. Elisa Measurement </h2>
            For the purpose of adding measurements to a study, one has to create the folder "measurements" in the
            main folder
            of the study and then add the folders, named accordingly to the measurements, into the measurements
            folder.
            For any measurement, the same five pieces of information are important: metadata, ligands, process,
            results, and raw_docs, results and raw_docs are optional. We start with an elisa measurement without any
            peptides involved.
            Let's begin with the most general measurement related information, the metadata.
            <h3> 2.1 Elisa Meta</h3>
            <table class="table table-striped">

                <tr>
                    <th>batch_sid</th>
                    <td> 12345689</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th> measurement_type</th>
                    <td> elisa</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th> functionalization</th>
                    <td> No</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>manufacturer</th>
                    <td> Thermo F96 Maxisorp</td>
                </tr>

            </table>
            The batch sid refers to the batch of the microwell plate. The measurement type
            has to be chosen from three choices: elisa, microarray and microwell. Both, microarray and microwell
            refer to fluoresence measurements. The functionalization refers to the surface substance
            of the microwell plate. In this measurement no ligands were bound to the surface of the microwell
            plate. Therefore, also no fuctionalization was necessary. We enter a "No", which is different to an
            empty space. An empty space refers to an unknown value
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN"> NaN </a>). The manufacturer refers to the manufacturer
            of the microwell plate. These are the metadata of a measurement. This table is saved as "meta.tsv"
            in the main directory of a measurement folder. Subsequently, we continue with the next
            important measurement related information: the ligands and their positions on the microwell plate.

            <h3>2.2 Elisa Ligands</h3>
            <p>
                Let's start with some general information related to ligands.
                Peptides, antibodies, viruses and any combination of several ligands (complexes) are referred to as
                ligands. Each of them is an ligand type and includes its specific information. A peptide, for
                example,
                is described by a linker, spacer, sequence and c-terminus. Besides the specific information,
                all ligands share the common fields: sid and comment. However, it might be interesting also to
                conduct
                measurements with e.g. different concentrations of the ligands, which is not captured by the ligands
                related
                pieces of information. Here, the concept of ligand batches comes into play.
                A ligand batch links a ligand to the following batch
                related properties: labeling, concentration, buffer, pH, purity and production date.
                Also for ligand batches, a sid has to be defined. Keep in mind that ligand batch sids are
                particularly important, because they are later on referenced in the gal files.
                Ligand batches, can be of five
                different types depending on what kind of ligand they are linked to: virus batch, peptide batch,
                antibody batch, complex batch and buffer batch. The buffer batch is a batch without a link to
                a ligand. The remaining four should be self explaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now back to our measurement. In this example we do not immobilize any ligands on the surface. This
                reduces our work. No, need to define any peptides or peptide batches. However, still we are
                supposed to deliver a so called gal file, which maps a ligand batch to a location on
                a microwell plate. Since no ligands are present in any well, we fill all entries in the table
                with "No". Note that the table has to have the same dimensions as the microwell plate.
                For microarrays it might be more reasonable to provide a gal file, which is fine too. This table
                is saved as "lig_fix.txt" in the main directory of the measurement.
            </p>

                Alright, fixed ligand location within the microwell are provided. Let's continue with the analyt
                ligand locations on the microwell plate. First, we check which analyts were incubated. For this
                example, we decided to
                pick the following: X31, Panama, California. One has to check if these viruses are already
                listed in the database. Therefore, let's open a new tab with the virus list by clicking the
                following <a href="{{ url('viruses') }}"> link </a> or on "Ligands" and than on "Virus" in the
                navigation menu. If the virus is already present in the database just note the sid and go on,
                otherwise search for the virus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">here</a> and
                provide the taxonomy id and relevant additional pieces of information for the virus, displayed
                in the table underneath. Virus data is general data and once provided,
                it can be used in any measurement. <a href="{{ url('virus_new') }}"> New viruses</a> and
                in general ligands can be created by clicking on the green plus symbol in each ligands table.

            Ok, now let's decide what kind of concentration we want to use or more generally speaking define the
            analyt batches. We are planning to incubate the three viruses in various concentrations but also
            some buffer as reference. First, one has to check again if the batches are already defined.
            Therefore, let's open a new tab with the virus batch list by clicking on the following
            <a href="{{ url('virusbatches') }}"> link </a> or on "Batches" and than on "Virus" in the
            navigation menu. In the following, we provide some batches, which we want to use for
            the incubation. Take a closer look on the column "ligand". It takes the preselected ligands sids.
            Again, you can create theses ligand batches by clicking on the green plus symbol in the
            <a href="{{ url('virusbatches') }}"> virus batches page </a> or on any other ligand batch page.

            For the buffer batch no ligands have to be provided.
            So now all batches are defined and we can continue with the gal file for the analyt.
            Just as a reminder, the gal file maps a ligand batch to a location on a microwell plate.
            In this example, we again display a rows and columns representation of the gal file, but again the
            the gal file representation is fine too.

            This information is saved as "lig_mob.txt" in the main directory of the measurement.
            Eventually, we completed all relevant ligand related data for our elisa experiment.

            <h3>2.3 Elisa Process</h3>
            Before digging into the specific process of our elisa measurement,
            let's start with a general description of a process.
            The process is described by process steps within a measurement.
            A process step can be of various types: blocking, drying, incubating-analyt, incubating,
            quenching, scanning, spotting and washing. Let me know if you have any suggestions for more.
            Each step is described by a sid , method, temperature and comment. Some of the steps take also the
            information substance and duration. Let's take a look at each step.

            <p> Once a process step is defined, it can be reused in any other process. Thus, it is part of the
                general data and is not exclusively related to one measurement. A process can contain many steps
                in an arbitrary ordering and with additional measurement specific pieces of information.
                We explain this concept based on our example. So, let's go back to our elisa example. </p>
            <p>
                Typically, the first step in the process is the spotting/immobilization step. However,
                no peptides are immobilized in this example. Instead, the first step is the incubation of an
                antibody. Steps are reusable elements, so let's check first if we declared a similar step
                <a href="{{ url('steps') }}"> here </a>. If not, you can define a new step again by clicking on
                the green plus symbol. For all the following steps during a measurement the same workflow
                applies. I give now a list of steps, which we use in this exemplary process.

            I go quickly through the table above. The first column "step" takes the sid of the step
            defined before hand.
            The second column "index" describes the chronological position of the step in the process.
            The "user" is the person who conducted this step. "Start" is the starting time of the step. The "image"
            field is left blank for every step in this example. Normally, it takes the name of an image file,
            which shall be saved in the main directory of the measurement folder. Generally, it is reasonable to
            use it for microarrays within the scanning step. There, images not intensities are the output of
            the reader. In the microarray measurement example (4.3) this is described in more detail.
            The opposite applies to microwell plates. The intensity file name can be plugin into the "intensity"
            field. Last, a "comment" can be written for every step.
            With all these pieces of information in place, we have complete all the relavant information
            related to the process. The above table has to be saved as "steps.tsv" into the main directory of a
            measurement.
            <h3>2.4. Elisa Results</h3>
            In this section, we are going to deal with pieces of information related to the measurement results.
            Measurement results describe the intensities resulting from the measurement. In this example, we
            measured the intensities during the last step of our process and saved tem as "intensity_final.tsv"
            in the main folder of the measurement. If we want to use these intensities as results we have to
            save it again in a folder within the results folder. It might seam to be a redundant procedure.
            However, the aim is to decouple the results from the process. In the microwell example, this approach
            might become clearer. There, multiple scans have been performed during one process. From theses scans
            different results have been obtained. Often, it might be interesting to subtract the background
            or to do even more sophisticated post-processing on the measured intensities and to show the output
            in as results. This concept makes it possible to do just that independently from the measured
            intensities.
            Again, the "sid" of the measurements results are defined by the folder name. This time the folder has to
            placed into
            the folder "results". We decided to call the result "raw".
            A results folder contains,besides the intensities, also some metadata related to the result.
            The following table shows the "meta.tsv" saved in our results folder.

            <table class="table table-striped">

                <tr>
                    <td>comment</td>
                    <td>results from an elisa intensity reader without any post processing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>processing_type</td>
                    <td>Elisa Intensity Reader 1.23</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>intensity_file</td>
                    <td>final_intensity.tsv</td>
                </tr>
            </table>


            <h3>2.5 Elisa Raw Docs</h3>
            Just like studies, also measurements can contain additional files (scientific papers, power
            point presentations,
            images , ...) , which do not fit into the database structure provided so far. Just upload them into
            the folder "raw_docs". For this elisa measurement, I don't have any additional data so we just leave
            the folder empty. Finally, we have finished with the elisa measurement.

            <h2>3. Microwell Measurement </h2>
            The microwell measurement will be in parts similar to the elisa measurement. The similar parts can
            be reused for this measurement. In particular, we are using the same analyt gal file and some of the
            process steps already defined during the elisa measurement.
            We are not going as much into detail with every step like in the elisa measurement. If anything is
            unclear check the procedure during the elisa and microarray measurement. This may already help.
            As a reminder,for any measurement these five data blocks have to be collected:
            meta, ligands, process, results, and raw_docs.
            The "sid" and thus the folder name of the microwell measurement has been choosen as
            "170929-tutorial-microwell-1".
            Just like fot the elisa measurement, we start again with the metadata.

            <h3>3.1 Microwell Meta</h3>

            </table>
            <h3>3.2 Microwell Ligands</h3>
            In the ligands section, one has to check first if the ligands and ligands batches are already
            defined. If not one has to click on the green plus symbol and add them to the database.
            Ligands are linked via their sid to the ligand batches. Ligand batches are referenced in the gal
            file as well via their sid. In contrast to the elisa measurement, we do want to immobilize
            peptides. The following table shows the peptides, which were used in this measurement.

            The field "ligand" again takes the sids from the predefined peptides. As you can see, many fields are
            left empty, this is due to lack of knowledge. Let's continue
            with the peptides gal file. In contrast to the elisa example, I show here the format of a gal file.
            The representations in the elisa example, however, would be fine too.

            We completed all information on fixed ligands and focus now on the analytes. We decided to use the
            same analytes, analyte batches and analyte gal file like in the elisa measurement.
            So we don't have to introduce new ligands and ligand batches but only copy/paste the analyte gal file
            from the elisa measurement. All relevant ligand related content is now provided.

            We have already declared some process step in the elisa measurement. The green marked process steps
            are the same as in the elisa measurement, so we would not have to declare them once again but just
            use the sids in the "steps.tsv". The process in this example was performed in the following way.

            </table>
            Note, that two scans have been performed and both result in a intensity file. These files are referenced
            in "steps.tsv" and have to be placed in the main directory of the measurement folder.

            <h3>3.4 Microwell Results</h3>
            In this example, we want to show how to upload three results. The first result will be the
            intensities from the the first scanning (process step 7), the second result will be the the
            intensity from the final scanning and the third will be a subtraction of one from the other.
            Have a look into the directory "170929-tutorial-microwell-1/results/" in the
            <a href="{{ url("tutorial_tree")}}"> directory tree </a>. Any directory in the results directory
            should have a "intensities.tsv" and a "meta.tsv". the intensities file contain gal file like
            intensities.
            The meta file contains a , "comment", "processing type" and "intensity_file" name.
            The processing type names the method how the intensities were generated
            (e. g. Florescence Reader, Genepix, Image2Numeric0.1, ...).
            The comments can be used to described more in detail how the intensity values have been obtained.
            Next, the content of "meta.tsv of the background subtraction result is shown. The other once can be
            found obviously in the
            <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"> zipped folder </a>.
            <table class="table table-striped">
                <tr>
                    <th> comment</th>
                    <td> subtracted the intensities of the first scanning from the second scanning.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th> processing_type</th>
                    <td> Fluorescence Intensity Reader 1.23</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th> intensity_file</th>
                    <td> intensity_sub.tsv</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>3.5 Microwell Raw Docs </h3>
            Further documents could be attached to any measurement. For this measurement, however,
            no further documents are attached.
            <h2> Microarray Measurement</h2>
            The microarray measurement will focus on incooperating multiple images in one measurement.
            For any measurement, the same five steps have to be performed: meta, ligands, process, results, and
            raw_docs. We decided to name the measurement: "170929-tutorial-microarray-1". So let's start again with
            the meta.

            <h3> 4.1 Microarray Meta</h3>
            <table class="table table-striped">

                <tr>
                    <th>batch_sid</th>
                    <td> ABC123_321</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th> measurement_type</th>
                    <td> microarray</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <th> functionalization</th>
                    <td> 3D-NHS</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>manufacturer</th>
                    <td> PolyAn</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>4.2 Microarray Ligands</h3>
            Again, ligands have to be defined before using them in a measurement.
            This procedure is always the same. If you want to add new ligands again click on the green plus
            symbol or follow the <a href="{{ url('peptide_new') }}"> link </a>. Remember the sids have to be
            unique. The same applies to the peptide batches. Relevant peptide batches for this example
            are also already defined <a href="{{ url('peptidebatches') }}"> here </a>.
            If you want to add new ligand batches again click on the green plus symbole or follow the
            <a href="{{ url('peptide_batch_new') }}"> link </a>. This time, I will not show the tables
            of new ligands and ligand batches. You can check for your self that all ligand batches referenced
            in the galfile are indeed present in the database.
            The microarrays were spotted with the industry spotter with 5200 spots.
            Therefore, I will also not show the content of the gal file in the browser but feel
            free to download the
            <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"> zipped folder </a>.

            <h3>4.3 Microarray Process</h3>
            Most of the process information is similar to the microwell example. The biggest difference is that
            several images are made during the scanning of the microarray plate. Again, we have to define new steps
            if not yet present in the database. Therefore, have a look at the
            exisiting process steps <a href="{{ url('peptide_batch_new') }}"> here </a> or click on process and
            than on process steps in the navigation menu. Create a new step by clicking the green plus symbol.
            In the following, steps performed during this measurement are shown.
