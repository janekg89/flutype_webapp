            <h1>Tutorial: How to upload data</h1>
             <p>
                Uploading data into the database consists of two main parts, filling in generic data reused in
                multiple experiments, and experiment or measurement specific data:
            </p>


            <ul>
                <li>The first part is the <b>creation of generic data</b> which is used in multiple
                    <code>measurements</code>
                    or <code>studies</code>.<br/>
                    This generic data is reused, e.g., <code>ligands</code> like peptides or viruses are only defined
                    once,
                    same for the respective <code>batches</code> (i.e., solutions of peptides, viruses and antibodies),
                    or the experimental steps (so called <code>process steps</code>) which are used in multiple
                    <code>measurements</code> or <code>studies</code>.<br/>
                    This generic data can be added/modified directly in the browser via the web interface (for instance
                    by
                    adding new peptides or viruses). A user must be logged in to add/modfiy this data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second part is the upload of <b>data specific for a given measurement/experiment</b>.<br/>
                    For the upload the information must hereby be provided in a specific directory structure,
                    i.e., certain files with defined names must exist in a given folder.<br/>

                    When creating the files in this specific directory structure, it is important to check
                    that the generic <code>ligands</code> (peptides, viruses, antibodies, ...), the used
                    <code>batches</code> (solutions of the ligands)
                    and the experimental steps (<code>process steps</code>) have already been uploaded in the database
                    (see generic information above).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The largest unit in the database is a so called <code>study</code> which
                refers to a collection of <code>measurements</code>. This tutorial leads through the workflow of
                uploading experimental data for an example <code>study</code> containing <code>measurements</code> from
                an
                ELISA binding assay (microwell plate), a peptide-virus binding experiment (microwell plate), and
                a peptide-virus binding experiment on a peptide-array.
            </p>

            <p>
                The specific directory structure for this example <code>study</code> is provided in the following
                supplementary
                file: <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"><span class="label label-danger">flutype-tutorial.zip</span></a>.
                The example study
                was uploaded in the FluTypeDB an is available <a href="{{ url("tutorial_db")}}"><span
                    class="label label-danger">here</span></a>.
                The directory tree of the study can be seen <a href="{{ url("tutorial_tree")}}"><span
                    class="label label-danger">here</span></a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the following a step by step tutorial to upload the example <code>study</code> is provided:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Creating a study</li>
                <li>Elisa measurements</li>
                <li>Microwell measurements</li>
                <li>Microarray measurements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> 1. Study </h2>
            <p>
                The name of the top directory of the tutorial <code>study</code> which we upload is used as a unique
                identifier <code>sid</code> (identification string) in the FluTypeDB for the study.
                This must be a unique identifier which is not yet used for another study in the database.
                In the tutorial the top directory name, and hence <code>sid</code>, is <span
                    class="label label-success">170929-tutorial</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study consists off three main building blocks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span></li>
                <li><span class="label label-success">measurements</span></li>
                <li><span class="label label-success">raw_docs</span>, i.e., additional documents and data files to
                    upload
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>metadata</code> defined in the <span class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span> file in the
                root
                of the study folder is the obligatory information of a study which describes the key features:
                what was the reason for the study and what should be answered (description),
                optional comments (comment),who is responsible for study (user), when was the study started (date),and
                what is the status of the study (status).

                <code>metadata</code> fields are hereby:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="label label-info">description</span>: text (a description)</li>
                <li><span class="label label-info">comment</span>:text (a comment)</li>
                <li><span class="label label-info">user</span> : username </li>
                <li><span class="label label-info">date</span>: format (YYYY-MM-DD) </li>
                <li><span class="label label-info">status</span>: one of the options: <span class="label label-default">planned</span>,
                    <span class="label label-default">in progress</span> and <span
                            class="label label-default">finished</span></li>
            </ul>

            <code>Studies</code> do not have to contain any measurements. One can add a study without any measurements
            or raw docs by adding a "meta.tsv" into a directory with the name of the study. All of the meta fields are
            optional,
            but should be filled out.
            <p>
                Anytime we describe the content of the experimental data directory and which files have to to placed
                in which locations, have a look at the tutorial example directory where this is demonstrated
                <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"><span class="label label-danger">flutype-tutorial.zip</span></a>
                and the corresponding
                directory tree at <a href="{{ url("tutorial_tree")}}"><span
                    class="label label-danger">directory tree</span></a>.
            </p>
            The following table shows the metadata of my study. This table is saved as <span
                class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span> in the main
            directory of the study. There is not yet any result defined.

                        and provide an overview about what kind of data can be uploaded and how the respective data
                        should be structured.

            <p>
                <code>Measurements</code> are defined in the <span class="label label-success">measurements</span>
                folder
                and can be uploaded for a study at any time, so it is
                completely legit to upload an empty study at the beginning and fill this step by step with the
                experimental <code>measurements</code>. At this point we have defined an empty study.
                How to add <code>measurements</code>, i.e., either ELISA, microarray or microwell measurements to
                the defined study is described in the following sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to <code>measurements</code> for a <code>study</code> it is also possible to
                upload documents related or important for the study by providing them in <span
                    class="label label-success">raw_docs</span> folder.
                These can be for instance experimental protocols, analysis, raw data files, etc. All
                documents of relevance for a study should be uploaded.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Elisa Measurement</h2>
            <p>
                To add <code>measurements</code> to a <code>study</code> one creates the folder <span
                    class="label label-success">measurements</span> in the
                study folder. For every <code>measurement</code> an individual <span class="label label-success">subfolder</span>
                is added
            </p>
            <p>
                For any measurement, five pieces of information are important:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span> (metadata)</li>
                <li><span class="label label-success">lig_fix.txt</span> and <span class="label label-success">lig_mob.txt</span>

            The <span class="label label-success">results</span> and <span class="label label-success">raw_docs</span>
            are optional.

            <p>
                The <span class="label label-info">batchsid</span> refers to the batch of the microwell plate. The <span
                    class="label label-info">measurement_type</span>
                has to be chosen from three choices:
                <span class="label label-default">elisa</span>,
                <span class="label label-default">microarray</span> and
                <span class="label label-default">microwell</span>. Both, microarray and microwell
                refer to fluoresence measurements. The <span class="label label-info">functionalization</span> refers to
                the surface substance
                of the microwell plate. In this measurement no ligands were bound to the surface of the microwell
                plate. Therefore, also no fuctionalization was necessary. We enter a "No", which is different to an
                empty space. An empty space refers to an unknown value
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN"> NaN </a>). The <span
                    class="label label-info">manufacturer</span> refers to the manufacturer
                of the microwell plate. These are the metadata of a measurement. This table is saved as <span
                    class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span>
                in the main directory of a measurement folder.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Elisa Ligands</h3>
            <p>
                Subsequently, we continue with the next
                important measurement related information: the <code>ligands</code> and their positions on the microwell
                plate.
            </p>
            <p>

                Peptides, antibodies, viruses and any combination of several ligands (complexes) are referred to as
                ligands. Each of them is an ligand type and includes its specific information. A peptide, for
                example, is described by a linker, spacer, sequence and c-terminus. Besides the specific information,
                all ligands share the common fields: sid and comment. However, it might be interesting also to
                conduct measurements with e.g. different concentrations of the ligands, which is not captured by the
                ligands
                related pieces of information. Here, the concept of ligand <code>batches</code> comes into play.
                A ligand batch links a ligand to the following batch
                related information: labeling, concentration, buffer, pH, purity and production date.
                Also for ligand batches, a sid has to be defined. Keep in mind that ligand batch sids are
                particularly important, because they are later on referenced in the gal files.
                Ligand batches, can be of five
                different types depending on what kind of ligand they are linked to: virus batch, peptide batch,
                antibody batch, complex batch and buffer batch. The buffer batch is a batch without a link to
                a ligand. The remaining four should be self explaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now back to our <code>measurement</code>. In this example we do not immobilize any ligands on the
                surface. This
                reduces our work. No, need to define any peptides or peptide batches. However, still we need a so
                called gal file, which maps a ligand batch to a location on
                a microwell plate. Since no ligands are present in any well, we fill all entries in the table
                with "No". Note that the table has to have the same dimensions as the microwell plate.
                For microarrays it might be more reasonable to provide a gal file, which is fine too. This table
                is saved as <span class="label label-success">lig_fix.txt</span> in the main directory of the
                measurement.

                At this point, fixed ligand location within the microwell are provided. Let's continue with the analyte
                ligand locations on the microwell plate. First, we check which analytes were incubated. In the tutorial
                example
                X31, Panama, and California were used. To use the viruses in the measurement these must already exist in
                in the database. Therefore, let's open a new tab with the virus list by clicking the
                following <a href="{{ url('viruses') }}"> link </a> or on "Ligands" and than on "Virus" in the
                navigation menu. If the virus is already present in the database just note the sid and go on,
                otherwise search for the virus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">here</a> and
                provide the taxonomy id and relevant additional pieces of information for the virus, displayed
                in the table underneath. Virus data is general data and once provided,
                it can be used in any measurement. <a href="{{ url('virus_new') }}"> New viruses</a> and
                in general ligands can be created by clicking on the green plus symbol in each ligands table.

            Now we define which concentrations were used, i.e., we want to use or more generally speaking define the
            analyte batches. We are planning to incubate the three viruses in various concentrations but also
            some buffer as reference. First, one has to check again if the batches are already defined.
            Therefore, let's open a new tab with the virus batch list by clicking on the following
            <a href="{{ url('virusbatches') }}"> link </a> or on "Batches" and than on "Virus" in the
            navigation menu. In the following, we provide some batches, which we want to use for
            the incubation. Take a closer look on the column "ligand". It takes the preselected ligands sids.
            Again, you can create theses ligand batches by clicking on the green plus symbol in the
            <a href="{{ url('virusbatches') }}"> virus batches page </a> or on any other ligand batch page.

            For the buffer batch no ligands have to be provided.
            At this point all batches are defined and we can continue with the gal file for the analyte.
            Just as a reminder, the gal file maps a ligand batch to a location on a microwell plate.
            In this example, we again display a rows and columns representation of the gal file, but again a
            gal file representation is fine too.

            At this point, we completed all relevant ligand related data for the ELISA experiment.

            <h3>2.3 Elisa Process</h3>
            The next step is to define the <code>process</code> of our ELISA measurement, i.e., which steps were
            performed
            in the experimental workflow. The process is described by <code>process steps</code> within a measurement.
            A process step can be of various types: blocking, drying, incubating-analyt, incubating,
            quenching, scanning, spotting and washing. Let me know if you have any suggestions for more.
            Each step is described by an sid, method, temperature and comment. Some of the steps take also the
            information substance and duration. Let's take a look at each step.

            <p> Once a process step is defined, it can be reused in any other process. Thus, it is part of the
                general data and is not exclusively related to one measurement. A process can contain many steps
                in an arbitrary ordering and with additional measurement specific pieces of information.
                We explain this concept based on our example. So, let's go back to our ELISA example. </p>
            <p>
                Typically, the first step in the process is the spotting/immobilization step. However,
                no peptides are immobilized in this example. Instead, the first step is the incubation of an
                antibody. Steps are reusable elements, so let's check first if we declared a similar step
                <a href="{{ url('steps') }}"> here </a>. If not, you can define a new step again by clicking on
                the green plus symbol. For all the following steps during a measurement the same workflow
                applies. I give now a list of steps, which we use in this exemplary process.

            </table>
            <p>
                I go quickly through the table above. The first column "step" takes the sid of the step
                defined before hand.
                The second column "index" describes the chronological position of the step in the process.
                The "user" is the person who conducted this step. "Start" is the starting time of the step. The "image"
                field is left blank for every step in this example. Normally, it takes the name of an image file,
                which shall be saved in the main directory of the measurement folder. Generally, it is reasonable to
                use it for microarrays within the scanning step. There, images not intensities are the output of
                the reader. In the microarray measurement example (4.3) this is described in more detail.
                The opposite applies to microwell plates. The intensity file name can be plugin into the "intensity"
                field. Last, a "comment" can be written for every step.
                With all these pieces of information in place, we have complete all the relevant information
                related to the process. The above table has to be saved as <span
                    class="label label-success">steps.tsv</span> into the main directory of a
                measurement.
            </p>

            <h3>2.4. Elisa Results</h3>
            <p>
                In this section, we are going to deal with pieces of information related to the measurement results.
                Measurement results describe the intensities resulting from the measurement. In this example, we
                measured the intensities during the last step of our process and saved tem as <span
                    class="label label-success">intensity_final.tsv</span>
                in the main folder of the measurement. If we want to use these intensities as results we have to
                save it again in a folder within the results folder. It might seam to be a redundant procedure.
                However, the aim is to decouple the results from the process. In the microwell example, this approach
                might become clearer. There, multiple scans have been performed during one process. From these scans
                different results have been obtained. Often, it might be interesting to subtract the background
                or to do even more sophisticated post-processing on the measured intensities and to show the output
                in as results. This concept makes it possible to do these things independently from the measured
                intensities.
                Again, the <span class="label label-success">sid</span> of the measurements results are defined by the
                folder name. This time the folder has to
                placed into the folder <span class="label label-success">results</span>. We decided to call the result
                <span class="label label-success">raw</span>.
                A results folder contains, besides the intensities, also some metadata related to the result.
                The following table shows the <span class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span> saved in the results
                folder.
            </p>


            <table class="table table-striped">
                <tr>
                    <td>comment</td>
                    <td>results from an elisa intensity reader without any post processing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>processing_type</td>
                    <td>Elisa Intensity Reader 1.23</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>intensity_file</td>
                    <td>final_intensity.tsv</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>2.5 Elisa Raw Docs</h3>
            <p>
                Just like studies, also measurements can contain additional files (scientific papers, power
                point presentations,
                images , ...) , which do not fit into the database structure provided so far. Just upload them into
                the folder "raw_docs". For this elisa measurement, I don't have any additional data so we just leave
                the folder empty. Finally, we have finished with the elisa measurement.
            </p>

            <!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

            <h2>3. Microwell Measurement</h2>
            <p>
                The microwell measurement will be in parts similar to the elisa measurement. The similar parts can
                be reused for this measurement. In particular, we are using the same analyte gal file and some of the
                process steps already defined during the elisa measurement.
                We are not going as much into detail with every step like in the elisa measurement. If anything is
                unclear check the procedure during the elisa and microarray measurement. This may already help.
                As a reminder,for any measurement these five data blocks have to be collected:
                meta, ligands, process, results, and raw_docs.
                The "sid" and thus the folder name of the microwell measurement has been choosen as
                <span class="label label-success">170929-tutorial-microwell-1</span>.
                Just like in the ELISA measurement, we start again with the metadata in <span
                    class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span>.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Microwell Meta</h3>

            </table>

            <h3>3.2 Microwell Ligands</h3>
            In the ligands section, one has to check first if the ligands and ligands batches are already
            defined. If not one has to click on the green plus symbol and add them to the database.
            Ligands are linked via their sid to the ligand batches. Ligand batches are referenced in the gal
            file as well via their sid. In contrast to the ELISA measurement, in this measurement no peptides were
            immobilized
            The following table shows the peptides, which were used in this measurement.

            The field "ligand" again takes the sids from the predefined peptides. As you can see, many fields are
            left empty, this is due to lack of knowledge. Let's continue
            with the peptides gal file. In contrast to the elisa example, I show here the format of a gal file.
            The representations in the elisa example, however, would be fine too.

            We completed all information on fixed ligands and focus now on the analytes. The
            same analytes, analyte batches and analyte gal file as in the ELISA measurement were used.
            So we don't have to introduce new ligands and ligand batches but only copy/paste the analyte gal file
            from the elisa measurement. All relevant ligand related content is now provided.

            Note, that two scans have been performed and both result in a intensity file. These files are referenced
            in <span class="label label-success">steps.tsv</span> and have to be placed in the main directory of the
            measurement folder.

            In this example, we want to show how to upload three results. The first result will be the
            intensities from the the first scanning (process step 7), the second result will be the the
            intensity from the final scanning and the third will be a subtraction of one from the other.
            Have a look into the directory <span class="label label-success">170929-tutorial-microwell-1/results/</span>
            in the

                class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span>.
            The intensities file contains a gal file like intensities.
            The meta file contains a <span class="label label-info">comment</span>, <span class="label label-info">processing type</span>
            and
            <span class="label label-info">intensity_file</span> name.

            The <span class="label label-info">processing_type</span> describes the method how the intensities were
            measured
            (e.g., Florescence Reader, Genepix, Image2Numeric0.1, ...).
            The <span class="label label-info">comment</span> can be used to described more in detail how the intensity
            values have been obtained.
            In the following, the content of <span class="label label-success">meta.tsv</span> of the background
            subtraction result is shown. The other results can be

                The microarray measurement will focus on incooperating multiple images in one measurement.
                For any measurement, the same five steps have to be performed: meta, ligands, process, results, and
                raw_docs. The measurement was named <span
                    class="label label-success">170929-tutorial-microarray-1</span>.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Microarray Ligands</h3>

            <p>
                Again, ligands have to be defined before using them in a measurement.
                This procedure is always the same. If you want to add new ligands again click on the green plus
                symbol or follow the <a href="{{ url('peptide_new') }}"> link </a>. Remember the sids have to be
                unique. The same applies to the peptide batches. Relevant peptide batches for this example
                are also already defined <a href="{{ url('peptidebatches') }}"> here </a>.
                If you want to add new ligand batches again click on the green plus symbole or follow the
                <a href="{{ url('peptide_batch_new') }}"> link </a>. This time, I will not show the tables
                of new ligands and ligand batches. You can check for your self that all ligand batches referenced
                in the galfile are indeed present in the database.
                The microarrays were spotted with the industry spotter with 5200 spots.
                Therefore, I will also not show the content of the gal file in the browser but feel
                free to download the <a href="{{ static('flutype/170929-tutorial.tar.gz') }}"> zipped folder </a>.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Microarray Process</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the process information is similar to the microwell example. The biggest difference is that
                several images are made during the scanning of the microarray plate. Again, we have to define new steps
                if not yet present in the database. Therefore, have a look at the
                existing process steps <a href="{{ url('peptide_batch_new') }}"> here </a> or click on process and
                than on process steps in the navigation menu. Create a new step by clicking the green plus symbol.
                In the following, steps performed during this measurement are shown.
